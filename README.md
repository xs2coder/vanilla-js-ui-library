# Vanilla UI Library

A collection of reusable, framework-free UI components built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🌟 Features

- No dependencies – pure JavaScript and CSS
- Each component is modular and self-contained
- Useful for rapid prototyping and personal projects
- Easy to copy/paste into any project

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `components/` – Individual UI components
- `shared/` – Utilities shared across components
- `styles/` – Global CSS like resets
- `demo.html` – Combined demo of all components

## 🚀 Components

| Component  | Preview  |
|------------|----------|
| Button     | `/components/button/index.html` |
| Modal      | `/components/modal/index.html`  |
| Dropdown   | `/components/dropdown/index.html` |

## 📦 Usage

Each component lives in its own folder with:

- `index.html`: Usage example
- `*.js`: JavaScript logic
- `*.css`: Scoped styles

You can directly import these into your own project.
